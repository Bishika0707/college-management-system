                    Dear Students and Parents, I feel honored to have this opportunity to communicate my
                    plan as the
                    Principal of MCD & DMHSS. Having served the education sector for more than three
                    decades, I have
                    come to learn that holistic education is imperative...
                </p>

                <div id="message-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        Our education system should ensure physical, psychological and intellectual
                        development of individuals to ensure desired quality in education. Quality in
                        education can be achieved only through proper planning and implementation of
                        appropriate education philosophy, guided by modern management practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such practices help address the interests of all stakeholders – students, parents,
                        faculties, and society at large – and ensure stronger teamwork. In this regard,
                        MCD & DMHSS has introduced Counseling Services, Coordination Mechanism, Evaluation
                        Mechanism, and Corporate Social Responsibility to support our academic mission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our Counseling Services help students overcome academic and personal problems and
                        plan their future accordingly. The Coordination Mechanism minimizes centralized
                        administrative complexities by decentralizing authority to program coordinators.
                        The Evaluation Mechanism enhances student and faculty performance by tracking
                        progress and suggesting necessary corrective actions. CSR aims to meet societal
                        expectations by awarding scholarships based on merit and need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that the integration of our qualified and dedicated faculties, conducive
                        environment, and modern management practices will yield the quality education you
                        deserve. I invite you all to be part of our academic journey and take full
                        advantage of the opportunities offered.
                    </p>
