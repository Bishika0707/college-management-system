                            <p style="color: black;">Dear Students and Parents,

                                I feel honored to have this opportunity to communicate my plan as the Principal of MCD &
                                DMHSS. Having served the education sector for more than three decades, I have come to
                                learn that holistic education is imperative for integrity and development of
                                individuals. Our education system should ensure physical, psychological and intellectual
                                development of individuals to ensure desired quality in education. Quality in education
                                can be achieved only through proper planning and implementation of appropriate education
                                philosophy, guided by modern management practices. Such modern management practices will
                                be helpful to address the interest of all the stakeholders ‚Äì students, parents,
                                faculties and society at large, and to ensure stronger team work. In this regard, MCD &
                                DMHSS has initiated practices like Counseling Services, Coordination Mechanism,
                                Evaluation Mechanism, and Corporate Social Responsibility to accomplish our academic
                                mission.

                                Our Counseling Services, operated by the counselor, will be useful for students to
                                overcome their problems - academic and personal, and will also be helpful to plan their
                                future as per their needs and interest. This service is important to inspire and
                                motivate students towards implementation of their academic and career plan. Similarly,
                                our Coordination Mechanism is helpful to minimize centralized administrative
                                complexities, through decentralization of authority to program coordinators, for
                                efficient and effective mobilization of faculties and sound operation of academic
                                session. Likewise, our Evaluation Mechanism promotes better performance of students and
                                faculties by measuring their performance, finding out deviation and suggesting
                                corrective actions, if required. Lastly, our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
                                intends to meet the social expectation of the society through scholarship program. Under
                                this program scholarships are awarded to deserving students based on merits, economic
                                status and performance.

                                I believe that the integration of our qualified and dedicated faculties, conducive
                                environment and modern management practices adopted by MCD & DMHSS will yield the
                                education that you desire for and deserve. So, I, hereby, would like to invite you all
                                to participate in our academic mission and take full benefit from it. <br> <br>

                                Best Regards,<br>
                                ‚Äî Principal, MCD & DMHSS
